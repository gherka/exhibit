    # please review each section and make necessary adjustments.

    # ----------------------------------------------------------
    # COLUMN DETAILS
    # ==============
    #
    # Dataset columns are categorised into one of the three types: 
    # Categorical | Continuous | Date
    #
    # Column type determines what parameters are included in the
    # specification. When making changes to the values, please
    # note their format. Values starting with a number must be
    # enclosed in quotes as per YAML rules.
    # 
    # CATEGORICAL COLUMNS
    # -----------
    # The default anonymising method for categorical columns is
    # "random", meaning original values are drawn at random,
    # (respecting probabilities, if supplied) but you can add
    # your own custom sets, including linked, by creating a
    # suitable table in the exhibit database (local or external).
    #
    # The tool comes with a number of sample anonymising sets
    # (see documentation). To use just one column from a set,
    # add a dot separator like so mountains.range
    # 
    # You can also use a subset of regular expression patterns 
    # to generate aliasing values in non-linked columns. For example,
    # if your confidential data had Consultant GMC numbers, you can
    # anonymise them using a regex pattern GMC[0-9]{5}[XY] which
    # will generate values like GMC00000X.
    #
    # Depending on the number of unique values in a column,
    # its original values can either be listed in the spec,
    # put into the exhibit database or, if the values follow a
    # one to one relationship with another column, be listed
    # as part of that column's section.
    #
    # UUID COLUMNS
    # -----------
    # UUID columns are a special case for categorical column where
    # each value is unique, but can appear multiple times depending
    # on the frequency distribution set by the user. You can add UUID
    # columns manually or infer them from the source data. If adding a
    # UUID column manually, don't forget to add it in the metadata section.
    #
    # The format of a UUID column in the specification is as follows. Note
    # that there is an optional "uuid_seed" parameter for cases when you want
    # to have differently seeded uuids in the same spec.
    # 
    # record_chi:
    #  type: uuid
    #  frequency_distribution:
    #  - frequency | probability_vector
    #  - 1         | 0.5
    #  - 2         | 0.3
    #  - 3         | 0.2
    #  miss_probability: 0.0
    #  anonymising_set: uuid
    #
    # You can choose between uuid, range and pseudo_chi anonymising sets.

    # NUMERICAL COLUMNS
    # ----------
    # Currently, only continuous data is supported. To use numerical
    # columns with discrete data, covert them to categorical or make
    # sure that the precision parameter is set to integer.
    # 
    # To generate Continuous columns you have two distribution options:
    #
    # - weighted_uniform
    # - normal
    #
    # The first option will generate the column by applying weights
    # to a fixed value before scaling it and optionally perturb it
    # within the dispersion percentage. With dispersion set to zero,
    # you can generate identical values for any given combination of
    # categorical values on the row.
    # 
    # A normal distribution will respect categorical weights by
    # shifting the mean accordingly. If dispersion is greater than
    # zero, the value before scaling is perturbed within the 
    # dispersion percentage.
    # 
    # You can also control how values are scaled by setting the
    # distribution target parameters. You must include at least one of
    # target_min, target_max, target_sum, target_mean or target_std.
    #  
    # Note that if you include certain constraints, like ensuring values
    # in one column are always greater than values in another column,
    # the final scaling of the column being adjusted will be affected.

    # CONSTRAINTS
    # ===========
    #
    # There are two types of constraints you can impose of the data:
    # - basic
    # - custom
    # 
    # Basic constraints take the form of a simple statement of the
    # form [dependent_column] [operator] [expression / independent_column].
    # The tool will try to guess these relationships when creating a
    # spec. You can also force a column to be always smaller / larger
    # than a scalar value. Note that adding a basic constraint between
    # two columns will affect the distribution of weights and also the
    # target sum as these are designed to work with a single column.
    #
    # Custom constraints are more flexible and can target specific
    # subsets of values with different actions. Currently the following
    # actions are supported:
    #
    # - "make_null"
    # - "make_not_null"
    # - "make_outlier"
    # - "sort_ascending"
    # - "sort_descending"
    # - "make_distinct"
    # - "make_same"
    # - "make_almost_same"
    # - "generate_as_sequence"
    # - "generate_as_repeating_sequence"
    # - "geo_make_regions"
    # - "sort_and_skew_left"
    # - "sort_and_skew_right"
    # - "sort_and_make_peak"
    # - "sort_and_make_valley"
    # - "shift_distribution_right"
    # - "shift_distribution_left"
    #
    # Adding or banning nulls is useful when a value in one column, 
    # like Readmissions Within 28 days, necessitates a valid value in
    # another, like Readmissions Within 7 days.
    # 
    # The format for custom constraints is as follows:
    #
    # demo_constraint_name:
    #   filter: (los > 2)
    #   partition: age, sex
    #   targets:
    #     taget_column: target_action
    #
    # Custom constraints can target multiple columns, but each column can
    # appear only once in each custom constraint.
    # 
    # Expressions used in the filter must be understood by Pandas eval().
    # Additionally, you can use these custom filters:
    #
    # - "COLUMN_NAME with_high_frequency"
    # - "COLUMN_NAME with_low_frequency"
    #
    # If a column name has spaces, make sure to surround it with
    # the tilde character ~. This rule only applies when columns are used
    # in basic constraints or filters. Targets for custom constraints must 
    # use column names as they are. When comparing a date column against a
    # fixed date, make sure it's in an ISO format and is enclosed in
    # single quotation marks like so '2018-12-01'.
